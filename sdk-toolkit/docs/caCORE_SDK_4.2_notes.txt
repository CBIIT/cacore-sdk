    caCORE SDK 1.0

    --  31 January 2005

    The caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools
    that can be used by an intermediate Java developer to create
    a 'caCORE-like' system. Such systems are constructed using
    certain design principles:

    --  UML Modeling

    --  n-tier architecture with open APIs

    --  controlled vocabularies

    --  registered metadata

    A system built along these lines is said to be 'semantically
    integrated', that is, there exists runtime metadata that
    describes every class and class attribute in the API.

    +---------------------------------------+

    caCORE SDK 4.2 is a minor release with several bug fixes and a handful
	of new features.  A list highlighting the functionality and 
	performance enhancements and improvements introduced in the caCORE SDK 
	4.2 release is provided below:

    -- Integration with the Automatic Build and Deploy Process (BDA)
    
    -- Integration with caGRID 1.3
	
	-- Integration with the caCORE Workbench, a new GUI-driven tool
	   which facilitates the creation of Data and Analytical Services   
	   on the Grid.  Supported caBIG process workflows include the 
	   creation of a UML Model, Semantic Integration, Model Mapping,  
	   Application Creation and Deployment, and creation of a Grid Service.
		
	-- REST API Error Handling. See GForge Feature Request[#15469].
	
	-- JSON output for REST API.  See GForge Feature Request [#15470].
	
	-- Change INCLUDE_PACKAGE code generation property value so that all classes in the domain 
	   model are selected by default.  See GForge Feature Request [#19446].
	   
	-- Provide link to Javadocs in the Domain Model Browser.  See GForge Suggestion Tracker [#16845].
	
	-- Include SDK version in the sdk-client-framework.jar Manifest.

================================================================
	3.0 Bug Fixes Since Last Release
================================================================

	-- [#18261] Possible Discrepancy between caAdapter and SDK API's is causing "No table found for <fqcn>" error.
	-- [#19565] Recursive proxying
	-- [#21256] GetXML represents nulls as dashes

================================================================
	4.0 Known Issues
================================================================

	-- [#18620] CACHE_PROTECTION_ELEMENT not working as desired

	-- [#16327] Pagination of result set causes incorrect construction of the result list

    -- [#13168] Polymorphic Implicit Inheritance queries fail if 
	firstResult/maxResult is set prior to executing query

    -- The SDK will not generate both ends of bi-directional 
	 associations within the Java Beans.

    -- The caCORE Castor-based Marshaller does not currently handle 
	 recursive bi-directional associations.	

    -- The SDK purposely ignores the lower-bound multiplicity
       value from the UML model when generating the Schemas.  A
       deployment option/property will be provided in a future 
       release that will force the SDK to honor the value placed
       within the model.

    -- When building a system, an error will be generated if
       Java keywords are used as class and/or attribute names in
       the UML logical model.  Similarly, SQL keywords in the
       data model will generate errors.
   
    -- If you use multiple datasources from different databases
       servers, the toolkit will not be able to generate
       multiple orm*.cfg.xml files automatically. You will need
       to generate a single ORM, then manually split that file
       into however many ORM's you are using.

    -- The HTTP interface has reserved characters like % and #.
       If the reserved characters are part of the query, the
       HTTP parser will not work correctly.
	
	 Example:  "test%122".  

	 A workaround is to use the wild card character '*':

	 Example:  "test*122"

       More detailed information is available in the caCORE
       4.2 SDK Programmer's Guide, available at:

       https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/docman/index.php?group_id=148&selected_doc_group_id=4183&language_id=1
	   
	-- The criteria query page is not displayed for implicit classes. See
	   [#15722] No Criteria page for the implicit class Tank.
	   
	-- [#23554] CSM Attribute Level Security does not Work as Expected 
	   Following SDK 4.2 Integration with CSM 4.2

	7.0 Documentation
================================================================
    
    -- The caCORE SDK 4.2 provides three guides.  The first, the "caCORE
       4.2 SDK Programmer's Guide", combines information formerly 
       contained within the caCORE SDK Programmer's, Technical, and 
       Basic Installation and Test guides.  The second, the "caCORE SDK 
       4.0 Migration Guide", contains information on migrating to the 4.0
       domain model from previous versions of the SDK.

    -- The caCORE SDK 4.2 Programmer's Guide can be downloaded via
       HTTP from:

       https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/docman/index.php?group_id=148&selected_doc_group_id=4183&language_id=1

    -- The caCORE SDK 4.0 Migration Guide can be downloaded via
       HTTP from:

       https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/docman/index.php?group_id=148&selected_doc_group_id=1389&language_id=1

    -- JavaDocs are also available for the generated domain classes.  
       To view them, first build the system for your model using the 
       instructions contained in "Chapter 11: Configuring and Running 
       the SDK" of the caCORE 4.2 Programmer's Guide.  The JavaDocs 
       are generated within the /target/dist/exploded/output/<project_name>
       /codegen/docs folder, and also included in the project ZIP file  
       located in /target/dist/ directory. Once the application is   
       deployed, the JavaDocs are also viewable online via the "JavaDocs" 
	   link on the SDK Home page.
