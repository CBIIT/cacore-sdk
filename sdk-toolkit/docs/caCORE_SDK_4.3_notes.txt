    --  31 January 2005

    The caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools
    that can be used by an intermediate Java developer to create
    a 'caCORE-like' system. Such systems are constructed using
    certain design principles:

    --  UML Modeling

    --  n-tier architecture with open APIs

    --  controlled vocabularies

    --  registered metadata

    A system built along these lines is said to be 'semantically
    integrated', that is, there exists runtime metadata that
    describes every class and class attribute in the API.

    caCORE SDK 4.3 is a moderate release with a few bug fixes and Feature Request
    implementations, as outlined below:

    --  Provide support for ISO 21090 Datatypes as class attributes

        unmarshalling of both ISO 21090 data types and non-ISO data types
		
    --  Provide support for selectively generating (enabling) the following interfaces:
	
        --  Local Java Interface
        --  Remote Java Interface
        --  Web Service Interface
        --  RESTful XML Interface
        --  RESTful HTML Interface
        --  RESTful JSON Interface		

    --  Provide support for CSM class-level security	
	
    --  Provide support for Blobs/Clobs in MySQL, Oracle and Postgres DB's 

    --  Provide support for selectively disabling pagination
	

================================================================
    3.0 Bug Fixes and Feature Requests Implemented Since Last Release
================================================================

    --  [#19979] Sync organization names in caGrid 1.2 Ivy and NCICB ivy (Feature Request)
	
    --  [#20474] Detect error on invalid multiplicity on the association (Feature Request)
	
    --  [#24626] SDK, CSM and CLM Application Database Schemas Must all be Dropped, or None at All (Bug)
	
    --  [#27044] Support for Blobs/Clobs in MySQL, Oracle and Postgres DB's (Feature Request)

    --  [#27045] Support for Selectively Disabling Pagination (Feature Request)

    --  [#27216] Support for Class Level Security (Feature Request)

================================================================
    4.0 Known Issues
================================================================

    --  The SDK will not generate both ends of bi-directional 
        associations within the Java Beans.

    --  The caCORE Castor-based Marshaller does not currently handle 
        recursive bi-directional associations.    

    --  The SDK purposely ignores the lower-bound multiplicity
        value from the UML model when generating the Schemas.  A
        deployment option/property will be provided in a future 
        release that will force the SDK to honor the value placed
        within the model.

    --  When building a system, an error will be generated if
        Java keywords are used as class and/or attribute names in
        the UML logical model.  Similarly, SQL keywords in the
        data model will generate errors.
   
    --  If you use multiple datasources from different databases
        servers, the toolkit will not be able to generate
        multiple orm*.cfg.xml files automatically. You will need
        to generate a single ORM, then manually split that file
        into however many ORM's you are using.

    --  [#13168] Polymorphic Implicit Inheritance queries fail if 
        firstResult/maxResult is set prior to executing query
       
    --  [#15722] No Criteria page for the implicit class Tank.  The criteria query 
        page is not displayed for implicit classes. 
		
    --  [#16327] Pagination of result set causes incorrect construction of the result list				
        
    --  If the Grid Security is enabled, the following Warning message is displayed on the JBoss 
        console:
        
        16:55:14,126 WARN  [Init] Exception while installing Function

        java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: org.apache.xpath.compiler.FunctionTable.installFunction(
        java.lang.String, org.apache.xpath.Expression)
        at java.lang.Class.getMethod(Class.java:1581)
        at org.apache.xml.security.Init.registerHereFunction(Unknown Source)

        This warning can be ignored.
		
    --  [#24850] Ambiguous nested query should raise Exception.  A nested query criterion with multiple paths between 
        the source and the target results in random behavior.  The workaround is to specify a fully-qualified query
        criterion.
		
    --  [#25705] SDK command line build failed if tomcat not closed manually. The workaround is to stop the server 
        manually, then re-execute the scripts.		

    --  [#26134] Implicit Inheritance test case fails due to Hibernate
	
    --  [#26135] Character data not supported for Webservices
	
    --  [#26136] Generated System doesn't support multiple association between objects.
	
    --  [#26528, #26529] Application Server (JBoss / Tomcat) occasionally fails to stop / start via the BDA scripts.
        The workaround is to stop or start the server manually, then re-execute the scripts.	
		
    --  [#28837] Unable to query AD and EN datatype through Restful API
    --  [#28840] Unable to query DsetII and other Dset datatypes through Restful API
        
    --  The HTTP interface has reserved characters like % and #.
        If the reserved characters are part of the query, the
        HTTP parser will not work correctly.
        
        Example:  "test%122".  

        A workaround is to use the wild card character '*':

        Example:  "test*122"

    A GForge Support tracker group, which is actively monitored by caCORE SDK 
    developers, has been created to track any support requests. If you believe 
    there is a bug/issue in the caCORE SDK software itself, or have a technical 
    issue that cannot be resolved by contacting the NCICB Application Support group, 
    please submit a new support tracker using the following link: 

    --  https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/?group_id=148&atid=731. 

    Prior to submitting a new tracker, review any existing support request trackers 
    in order to help avoid duplicate submissions.

    6.0 caCORE Open Development
================================================================

    The NCICB caCORE Software Development Kit is part of a suite
    of open tools designed to aid in the design and creation 
    of a 'caCORE-like' software system.  For more information,
    refer to:
        
    --  https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/tools/caCORE_SDK
    --  http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/projects/cacoresdk/
     

================================================================
    7.0 Documentation
================================================================
    
    The caCORE SDK 4.3 provides two guides.  The first, the "caCORE
    4.3 SDK Programmer's Guide", combines information formerly 
    contained within the caCORE SDK Programmer's, Technical, and 
    Basic Installation and Test guides.  The second, the "caCORE SDK 
    4.0 Migration Guide", contains information on migrating to the 4.0
    domain model from previous versions of the SDK.

    The caCORE SDK 4.3 Programmer's Guide can be downloaded via
    HTTP from:

    -- https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/docman/admin/index.php?group_id=148&selected_doc_group_id=5772&language_id=&selected_stateid=1

    The caCORE SDK 4.0 Migration Guide can be downloaded via
    HTTP from:

    --  https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/docman/index.php?group_id=148&selected_doc_group_id=1389&language_id=1

    JavaDocs are also available for the generated domain classes.  
    To view them, first build the system for your model using the 
    instructions contained in the "How to Use the SDK" wiki, located at:
	
    --  How to Use SDK v4.3 Guide v1:  https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/f5ePAQ	
	
    The JavaDocs are generated within the /target/dist/exploded/output/<project_name>
    /codegen/docs folder, and also included in the project ZIP file  
    located in /target/dist/ directory. Once the application is   
    deployed, the JavaDocs are also viewable online via the "JavaDocs" 
    link on the SDK Home page.
