<h1>Semantic Integration</h1>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal">Semantic 
Integration is the process of taking the elements of a systems and binding 
those elements' terms to a common vocabulary. This process ensures that while 
the structure and purpose of the systems might be different, they are speaking 
the same language and can therefore more easily exchange the information 
contained within them.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal">The process of 
Semantic Integration involves first annotating a UML model with terms from a 
common vocabulary (called "concepts") and then using those terms to bind the 
UML model elements to standardized metadata elements called Common Data 
Elements or CDEs. These CDEs are located in a metadata registry called the 
Cancer Data Standards Repository, or caDSR.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal">So the first
thing is to delineate the difference between semantic annotation and semantic
integration, as they are two different steps toward the same goal.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Semantic Annotation</b> is the process of
adding tagged values to a UML model that describe the semantics of the elements
in the model. These semantics are described using terms from a common
vocabulary. Basically, semantics are the language you use. You annotate your
terms with definitions, so that if you use the term "agent" it is
clear that you mean "a medication or other item used to produce an
effect" and not "a real-estate representative" or "a
government spy". If everyone using the term "agent" in the same
way also uses the same definition from the common vocabulary, then we are all
clear that we are using the same language (semantics). </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Semantic Integration</b> is the process of
loading these annotated models into a centralized registry and equating the
elements in the models with common data elements, bringing together all of the
annotated representations of data into a single, accessible location. When the
elements in your model become represented as caDSR metadata, your model is
considered to be semantically integrated.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal">NCI CBIIT
provides a variety of tools to assist you in both semantically annotating and
semantically integrating your system. In addition, there are caDSR tools that
allow you to manage the metadata associated with your system, a process called
&ldquo;curation.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>caDSR Toolset</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Semantic Integration Workbench (SIW) - </b>The
Semantic Integration Workbench (SIW) is a tool to help automate the semantic
annotation process. As stated above, semantic annotation involves mapping the
elements in a UML model to definitions in a common vocabulary. The SIW performs
this association using an XMI file exported/saved from the UML modeling program
used to create the model.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>While you can manually annotate the UML model
to achieve semantic integration (by adding all of the necessary tagged values
yourself), the SIW streamlines and partially automates the process of semantic annotation,
and requires detailed review and approval of each element before a model can be
registered into caDSR. Manual annotation has the potential to introduce human
errors that can cripple metadata registration and the UML Loader.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal">Once the model
owner and the EVS curation team have approved the annotated version of the
model, the annotated XMI file is sent to the caDSR team to be transformed into
caDSR metadata via the UML Loader.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal"><b style="">UML Model Loader - </b>The UML Loader or
UML Model Loader is a Java application that transforms UML domain models into
caDSR metadata, reusing existing caDSR administered items or creating new ones
as needed. This process is also referred to as registering the UML model in
caDSR.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal">The UML Loader
transforms the UML model information from an annotated XMI file into caDSR
metadata while also mapping the registered metadata back to the UML model that
uses it. This metadata registration into the caDSR is performed ONLY by a team
at CBIIT, working with model owners to be sure that the information from their
model is registered properly.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal"><b style="">UML Model Browser</b> - As its name
implies, this tool allows you to browse the caDSR for data elements based on
the UML Model to which they are registered. You can search for specific pieces
of metadata and see what models use them, or you can select a model from the
tree view of the browser and see all the metadata elements resident in the
selected model.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal"><b style="">CDE Browser </b>- Again the name of the
tool describes what it does. You can use the CDE Browser to look through the
caDSR and view the data elements contained there. You can search for data
elements, value domains, data element concepts, and properties, among many
others. The search capability of the CDE browser is very powerful and can help
you find just about anything in the caDSR you may be searching for.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Forms Builder</b> - This tool lets you
search the caDSR for data elements and then use those elements to build forms
for use by your organization (and by other organizations if they find them
useful). This tool works in conjunction with the CDE Browser to provide a
complete tool for building and maintaining informational forms.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Sentinel Tool</b> - The Sentinel tool
allows you to set alerts on items in the caDSR, so that if an item changes, you
can be immediately notified of the change.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; " class="MsoNormal"><b style="">CDE Curation Tool</b> - This tool allows
you to both search for caDSR metadata but also allows you to edit metadata that
you own. If your model introduced a new data element into caDSR, that item
belongs to you and your context, and you may need to make changes to that item
at some point.</p>
