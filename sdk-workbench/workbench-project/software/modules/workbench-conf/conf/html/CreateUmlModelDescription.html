<h1>Create UML Model</h1>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal">The caCORE software development
process follows a Model Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigm. In MDA, the
application development starts with creating a UML model for the underlying
system. Creation of a UML model provides, essentially, a software blueprint of
the system.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal">UML provides a generic mechanism to
represent the various parts of a software system and its lifecycle. When the UML
model is constructed in the UML modeling tool, the information about the model
is stored in the modeling tool's proprietary formatted file.</p>

<h1>UML Modeling for caCORE</h1>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal">In the caCORE process, all the caCORE
tools interpret the Logical Model portion of the UML Model. In addition, the
caCORE SDK and caAdapter tool, also interprets the Data Model portion of the
UML Model. caCORE tools are capable of processing most of the common elements
of the UML class diagrams. Developers should check the caCORE UML Modeling wiki
site at https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/caCORE/UML+Modeling for more details
on the modeling rules supported by the caCORE tools to avoid any setbacks.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal">UML by itself is unable to describe
how the complete system works after implementation. To efficiently generate
code from a UML model, the caCORE tools specifies additional information (in
the form of tag values) that needs to be embedded inside the model. This
additional information allows the caCORE to determine how the semantic
integration and code generation process should proceed. In order for the caCORE
tools to read the model, the model information needs to be translated into a
standard format that can be interpreted by other modeling tools.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal">Currently the caCORE tools use a
UML model reader, also known as the XMI Handler, which can interpret model
information created by either Enterprise Architect or ArgoUML. Enterprise
Architect (EA) and ArgoUML (v0.24 and v0.26) are the officially supported UML
modeling tools for use with the caCORE suite of products.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal">More details on how to create UML
model can be found in the &quot;Creating the UML Model for caCORE SDK&quot; of the SDK
4.x Programmer's Guide, which is available for download from the SDK GForge
site at:</p>
