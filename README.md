Welcome to the caCORE SDK Project!
=====================================

The caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK) generates a system built on the principles of Model Driven Architecture (MDA), n-tier architecture and a common API for data access. The use of MDA and n-tier architecture allows for easy access to data, particularly by other applications.

When the caCORE SDK-generated system is combined with controlled vocabularies and registered metadata, the resulting software system, called "caCORE-like" system, is "semantically integrated." All exposed API elements have runtime accessible metadata that defines the meaning of the elements using controlled terminology.

The caCORE SDK has two modules:
* Code Generation, which accepts a UML model as input and produces java classes and other artifacts such as a standard XML Schema (xsd) that can be used by standard client APIs
* Middleware, that provides the actual infrastructure including the server and standard client APIs to provide access to the underlying data system through n-tier architecture

The caCORE SDK is distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License.
